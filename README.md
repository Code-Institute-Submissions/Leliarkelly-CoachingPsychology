<h1>Coaching-Psychology</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Coaching Psychology is a successful executive coaching business run by Ali Reardon.  The business has been running for 5 years and Ali has over 2,500 hours of coaching experience across a broad range of sectors.   The company provides 1:1, group and resilience coaching programme. The company has access to a pool of highly qualified, talented and experienced coaches across the UK.  The company currently has a website that can be found at www.coaching-psyhology.co.uk. 
Interviews were conducted with Ali Reardon to identify her business goals, requirements and ideas for a new improved website. 

Ali is passionate about her business and services she can offer.   She wants to expand her business and believes that she needs to improve her online presence to attract more business for her and her pool of associates.

Areas of concerns were identified with the current website that needs to be addressed:
-	The website design was poor and not very attractive or particularly appealing to new users.  It does not show Ali’s company in a particularly good light
-	The site is not optimised for use on different size of devices.
-	The worry is that many visitor might not stay on the site once they arrived at it.
The main agreed goal was to build a better, clearer and more attractive looking website which better sells the services that Alison's company has to offer.

<h2>Project Brief</h2>

The project brief was to build an improved static front-end site to present useful information to potential customers of Coaching Psychology, using the following technologies HTML, CSS and other frameworks: Bootstrap, Font awesome, and Google fonts.
Project Approach

The project would follow broadly an agile project lifecycle whereby requirements would be captured as user stories, and prioritised into time-limited sprints of development, which would then be tested and released following customer approval.  This would be an iterative process.   Work for each sprint would be influenced by retrospective on each sprint.

<h2>Requirements gathering: User stories</h2>

A user story is a great way of describing users’ needs.  By writing user stories it helped us focus on what the users of the website will want to achieve when visiting the website.   We wrote the following stories for this project and prioritised them.  It was agreed that initial development would meet needs described in Sprint 1 user stories followed by Sprint 2.  Those added to the backlog would be prioritised and scheduled at a later stage during the website development life cycle.

<h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>

When planning for each sprint it was difficult to estimate how long each piece of development would take.
As a developer I got side tracked while developing the site on features that were not in the initial brief.  

I was still learning while in development which added time it took to develop the website.  I am confident as I develop this website and others I will be able to improve on the amount of work that gets done and released.

We deployed for testing and the majority of test passed except the video on the service pages which did not look great on different devices.   So we decided to remove video styling as we were unable to fix the responsiveness of the video and save for a future release

Ali Reardon was very happy with the final website and feels positive about the further website developments we have planned in future sprints.

<h2>Deployment Strategy </h2>
1) Made sure text is accurate and error free.
2) Ensured  design is good.
3) Tested the site for User Experience (UX).
4) Final show and tell and sign off my owners
5) Created a backup of site. 
    a) Cloned respository
    b) Backed up and saved to local directory
6) Published final website
